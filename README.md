Reinforcement learning experiment of my study for two wheel machine

You could execute the command like the following;

Initialize & learning execution
`python twn_twn_DDQN.py`

Load & learning execution
`python twn_twn_DDQN.py --load=agent`

Load & demo execution
`python twn_twn_DDQN.py --load=agent --demo`

If you would like to execute demo with the learned data, please copy "ok_agent_cnnae_ddqn" to "agent."
"agent" folder will be loaded by `--load` option.
